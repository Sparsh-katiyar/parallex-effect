        <h4>The University of California, San Francisco is a public land-grant research university in San Francisco, California. It is part of the University of California system and is dedicated entirely to health science and life science. It conducts research and teaching in medical and biological sciences
        <br>UCSF was founded as Toland Medical College in 1864. In 1873, it became affiliated with the University of California as its Medical Department. In the same year, it incorporated the California College of Pharmacy and in 1881 it established a dentistry school. Its facilities were located in both Berkeley and San Francisco.[12] In 1964, the school gained full administrative independence as a campus of the UC system, headed by its own chancellor, and in 1970 it gained its current name. Historically based at Parnassus Heights with satellite facilities throughout the city, UCSF developed a second major campus in the newly redeveloped Mission Bay district in the early 2000s.</h4>

    <h2>JHONS HOPKIN UNIVERSITY
  </h2>
   </div>
   <h4>The university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur and Quaker philanthropist Johns Hopkins.[8] Hopkins's $7 million bequest to establish the university was the largest philanthropic gift in U.S. history up to that time.[9][10] Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as Johns Hopkins's first president on February 22, 1876,[11] led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research.[12] In 1900, Johns Hopkins became a founding member of the American Association of Universities.[13] The university has led all U.S. universities in annual research and development expenditures for over four consecutive decades ($3.18 billion as of fiscal year 2021)</h4>

  <h2>UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE</h2>
</div>
<h4>In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter, granted by King Henry III. The University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. The largest department is Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which has £1 billion of annual revenue and reaches 100 million learners.[11] All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.</h4>
<div class="bg bg7">
  <h2>UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD</h2>
</div>
<h4>The University of Oxford is made up of 43 constituent colleges, consisting of 36 semi-autonomous colleges, four permanent private halls and three societies (colleges that are departments of the university, without their own royal charter),[15][16] and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[17] Each college is a self-governing institution within the university, controlling its own membership and having its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] The university does not have a main campus, but its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.</h4>

<h4>Stanford is one of the most successful universities worldwide in attracting funding for start-up companies and in also licensing its inventions to existing businesses.[15][16][17][18][19] Alumni have founded numerous corporations, which when combined equal the tenth-largest economy in the world.[20] In 1951, the Stanford Research Park was established in Palo Alto and is the world's first university research park.[21] By 2021, the university had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical faculty on staff</h4>

<h2>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</h2>
</div>
<h4 class="text">By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[11][12] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[13] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.</h4>
